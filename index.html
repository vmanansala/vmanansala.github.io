        She is beauty </p> 
<p>Casting down her rays on the people </p>
<p>Holding up the universe </p>
<p>That she calls her own </p>
<p>A symbol of strength. <p>
<p>I praise thee who holds the universe I live in together </p>

<p>
She reigns over all the other stars </p>
<p>And for that she is almighty, beautiful, and strong- </p>
<p>All in one.</p>
<p>Blazing her rays on life;</p>
<p>She is powerful </p>
<p>She is the reason why we eat, breathe, and live</p>
<p>Without her we are nothing </p>
<p>She controls the start of each day </p>
<p>And controls the beginning of each night </p>

<p>
But apart from all the beauty
She is ruthless
holding rage within her
Hoping no one will come too closely to her </p>

<p>
But, she is beauty. </p>
<p>
Holding up everything that revolves around her </p>
<p>
Appearing every morning </p>
<p>
And disappearing every night </p>

<p>
I am her </p>
<p>She is me</p>
<p>Making daily appearances</p>
<p>Filled with heat and beauty </p>
<p>That can attract or push one away </p>
<p>I am a fire sensation </p>
<p>Getting to close to me can harm you</p>
<p>For I have tendencies to hurt someone</p>
<p>Filled with nothing but fire and insecurities </p>
 
<p>
I am her and she is me </p>
<p>I am nothing but merely a star playing my role in the universe</p>
<p>Hoping no one gets too close to me</p>
<p>And leaves
